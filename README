Forked from: https://github.com/d-grossman/scrapeCars

Changed some scripts and collected car URLs up to 2018. Use
```
python downloadFiles.py car
```
along with the car dataset found in datasets to start collecting car images. Other options [mpv, truck].

-----
general workflow:
  make a datafile of all the URLS to crawl
  use datafile to download the URLS to local files
  verify the filetypes are accurate (only want images)
  verify the file contents using ResNet50 (only want images containing a specific thing..)
  generate additional classes/tags for future training
  cut dataset into training and testing
  ...
  profit
